# multi-container-spring-boot-application-e
This project aims to create a multi container application based on spring-boot and mongodb
We will learn to create a spring-boot api for a sample project. Main focus of this small project to create a student record management api in spring-boot which connect to the mango database. We will create docker image for our application and then run our application with docker-compose CLI to create multi-container application. I am creating this application as a working example for myself. I may help you to understand how container works and to orchestrate two container. On the similer line, we can connect muti-container application talking to each other and searving for a purpose.
So let's start step by step. I will be taking abot small small thing which may help in understanding the flow of the code. Tools which I have used in this example are
1. Docker
2. docker-compose
3. maven
